  #Monolith Station Rules

  ##Foreword

  Servers are often a diluted mess of rules and restrictions that hinder players' creative abilities and freedom to craft their own experiences.

  Our vision is centered on empowering players to handle most, if not all, situations independently.

  Remember, [bold]this is just a game; nothing more[/bold]. We do expect, at the very least, that you [bold]stay in-character, adhere to the setting, and engage in quality roleplay to the best of your abilities[/bold]. This ensures your enjoyment and enhances the experience for the other players around you.

  [color=red]If any of the links do not work, use the guidebook version on the escape or (Numpad 0) menus. [/color]

  [color=red]These rules are expected to be read in their entirety.[/color]

  ##Admin Decisions
  - All admin decisions are final.
  - Rules are enforced to the spirit of the rules and subject to admin interpretation.
  - Admins may disregard any/all rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, the server, and/or the community.
  - Admins are accountable for their actions. Abuse of admin privileges will be dealt with by staff.

  ##General Information
  - Disconnecting from or ignoring/evading admin-helps will result in an appeal-only ban.
  - Admins are not obligated to cover player losses, deaths or delays.
  -- This includes, but is not limited to: ship deeds, money, respawns and revivals.
  -- Any action taken is at the staff's discretion, and depends on the circumstances.
