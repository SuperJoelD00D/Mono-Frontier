reagent-name-fent = fentanyl
reagent-desc-fent = A highly potent opioid painkiller and narcotic. Its highly addictive, and horribly abused. When mixed with Tricordrazine at a 5:1 ratio (5u Fentanyl, 1u Tricordrazine), and heated to 310k, it is solidified, and highly valuable. Its very explosive with dylovene, and as such you can only crystallize one at a time.
